Trouble Shooting Errors (Build or Otherwise Weird)

1) Check SVN and try to commit.  Check to see what file has been changed.  Revert if necessary.
2) If that's not it, check Java log in tomcat (Cygwin cd trunk/tomcat/logs tail -200 wsd_error.log)
3) If it's language related, check your environment variable to make sure it is correct
4) Check DBUtils to make sure you are pointed to the right server
5) You might have to run some SQL server packs or something that updates SQL, especially if you haven't been there in awhile.
